# ojocoin-cryptocurrency

A blockchain-backed cryptocurrency implementation in Python; powered by Flask. 


## Installation

Clone the repo and install all the requirements:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/manuelinfosec/ojocoin-cryptocurrency
  cd ojocoin-cryptocurrency
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Usage

After installation, run our the `main.py` and `run.py` on two separate terminals, which replicates how it would be if it was running on two different computers:

On Computer 1:
```bash
python main.py
```

On Computer 2:
```bash
python run.py
```

Open the respective links in two seperate browser windows. 

Here's how it would look like in two separate windows

If both are connected to the same network, you may have to tweak the `main.py` and `run.py` with their respective LAN addresses.
